# Fruit-Classification using Artificial Intelligence

## PROJECT SCOPE

Recognition of fruits in the natural environment becomes challenging due to the involvement of
complex backgrounds. This problem has also been addressed in the literature. Their approach is
based on the principle that there is a big difference in curvatures between edge points on the edge
produced by occlusion and the edge points on the edge without occlusion. In the classification
based methods, first the system train a classifier with the feature descriptors of the training images and
finally classify the test images to a category using trained classifier and feature descriptor of the test
image.

## Implemantation
The developed methodology is consisting of three steps. In the first step we will analyze the
given data. In the second step feature is extracted from the dataset. In this we proposed a texture
feature to enhance the classification accuracy. In the last step classification of fruit take place on
the basis of knowledge gain during training phase.

## tool
##### SPYDER
Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and
for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It offers a unique combination of the advanced editing,
analysis, debugging, and profiling functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the
data exploration, interactive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization capabilities
of a scientific package.

## ALGORITHM
here, I used three of the classification based algorithms to compare the accuracy level .

##### DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER:
A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature (or
attribute), the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. The
topmost node in a decision tree is known as the root node. It learns to partition on the basis of the
attribute value.
##### NAVIE BAYES ALGORITHM:
In simple terms, a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a
class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. For example, a fruit may be considered to
be an apple if it is red, round, and about 3 inches in diameter.
##### SVM ALGORITHM:
In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of
features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then,
we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiate the two classes very.
